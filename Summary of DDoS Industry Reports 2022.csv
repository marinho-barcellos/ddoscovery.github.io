Almost no report clarified how attacks with multiple vectors were counted; the notable exception was Qrator.","Generally, information was not present or had to be inferred from graphs showing the variation of some metric through time (weeks, months, quarters, years). The graphical representation of some plots made it hard to read the values. It was often the case that values oscillated wildly from period to period, such as quarter to quarter.","Reports generally differed in the set of intervals chosen to group attack durations, making it very hard to compare results among reports. For example, while one report may have used 0-1min, 1-10min, and > 10min, another may have used < 5min, 5-10min, 10-60min, > 60min.","Reports generally differed in the set of intervals chosen to group attack intensity, making it very hard to compare results among reports. For example, while one report uses < 1 Gbps, 1-100 Gbps, > 100 Gbps, another could have used 0-5 Mbps, 5-1000 Mbps, > 1000 Mbps.","Many different terms were used to refer to carpet-bombing. These include ""horizontal attacks"", ""prefix attacks"", and ""bit-and-piece"". Some reports ignore the technique, while others emphasise it, to make the point that attacks are becoming harder to mitigate.","While 11 reports completely ignore the issue of multi-vector attacks, some reports highlight it, as a way to emphasise the growing complexity of attacks.","In this column, ""target"" may refer to very different aspects of attacks. We considered analysis of targeted Industries and/or regions/countries (potentially linked to geopolitical issues); we did not consider the attack layer or type of service (e.g. DNS). It is possible that reports often highlighted the affected industries to make the business case that they need to pay for protection, and protection needs to be effective against increasingly more powerful and more complex attacks. In 5 reports, there was no information. many cases. The grouping of Industries or sectors (the terms used) varied substantially, and the numbers were very different among reports.","Some of the reports state that the data comes from their networks. One (F5) acknowledges explicitly the impact that this may have on the generalisation of trends. Generally, reports do not clarify how the data was collected, from which regions of the globe, if from enterprises or ISPs, etc. There are some notable exceptions, such as Netscout. Many reports (A10, Arelion, Lumen, Netscout, and NexusGuard) highlight the need for Internet and attack visibility."
