        reflected amplified SYN+ACK attack on an Azure resource in Asia. The attack reached 30 million packets per
        second (pps) and lasted 15 seconds. Attack throughput was not very high, however there were 900 reflectors

        threat landscape. Without visibility, it would be extremely difficult to create a timeline of history, identify
        trends, and adequately prepare for and defend against network-based attacks such as DDoS. Our global sensor
        network gives NETSCOUT incredible visibility into the networks around the world, allowing us to see a staggering
        401+ Tbps average of internet traffic (Figure 3)—an estimated 50 percent of international transit capacity. That

            the leading attack vector throughout the year</span>, except for the first quarter of the year, when the SYN
        Pood was the top technique.&quot;<br>&quot;In the attack vector statistics without concurrency, we again see the
        prevalence of the UDP flood, although the proportion is lower than in Q3 when it was 51.79%. The SYN flood has
        gained the most, rising from 20.37% in Q3 to 41.34% in Q4.&quot;<br><span style="font-style:italic;">We note
            that the numbers presented in the report do not include any form of

        category in Q4 2022 is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Request Rate Patterns</span>, which includes anything
        that deviates from what is expected from a legitimate user in terms of request rate, and collected <span
            style="font-weight:bold;">30.37% of Q4 2022 application layer attacks</span>. It is followed by Rotating
        Client Secondary Attributes, which refers to an <span style="font-weight:bold;">unusual set of headers in the
            request</span>, and accounts for more than a quarter - <span style="font-weight:bold;">28.05%</span> - of L7
        DDoS attacks. That differs from the third category, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Abnormal URL
            Traversal</span>, which is exactly what it sounds like - an action that a legitimate user often wouldn&#39;t
        even be able to perform, where we saw <span style="font-weight:bold;">11.77%</span> of the attack data. <span
            style="font-weight:bold;">Broken HTTP semantics now accounts for &quot;only&quot; 6.88% of L7
            attacks</span>. The top four categories together account for 77.07% of L7 attacks, with 13.10% in Multiple

    <td dir="ltr">The diagram &quot;Attack Vectors Concurrency&quot; shows a detailed breakdown of vectors.
        <span style="font-style:italic;">This is more accurate than similar plots in other reports since it represents
            both isolated and concurrent use of vectors. <br></span>&quot;As we mentioned earlier, the interchange
        between IP (fragments) flood and UDP flood quarter over quarter is somewhat highly expected. Additionally, we
        expect this trend to stay in the future. The reason is attackers are trying to improve the overall efficiency of
        their devices by choosing larger amplification targets (like DNS records), and it is pretty standard that those
        chunks of data significantly surpass the MTU limit. Thus fragmentation is inevitable.&quot; <span
            style="font-style:italic;">The example indicates that large DNS responses, likely from amplification, can be
            reported as IP fragmentation.<br></span>&quot;The top-3 vectors combined make 77.69% of all the mitigated
        attacks&quot;<br>

            (13.11%) than other quarters (43.20%, 23.20%, 20.50%). The same reduction in Q4 was </span><span

    <td dir="ltr">&quot;Comparing the duration data QoQ, the average attack time has almost doubled - from
        1510 seconds in Q3 2022 to 2503 seconds in Q4. However, the median duration decreased for the first time since
        Q2 2022, from 390 seconds to 210 seconds.&quot;<br>&quot;But the longest attack in Q4 lasted for 250,500 seconds
        - <span style="font-weight:bold;">more than 69 hours</span>, which is still less than what we&#39;ve seen during

        especially Q1, when one attack lasted for <span style="font-weight:bold;">almost 11 days</span>.&quot;</td>
    <td dir="ltr">&quot;On the bandwidth side of the attacks, we see that UDP flood and TCP flood are closer
        at the maximums - <span style="font-weight:bold;">621.86 Gbps and 480.8 Gbps</span> respectively. However, the
        difference is much more significant in the median, where the UDP flood shows 1.79 Gbps, which is still more than
        two times lower than the IP flood median bandwidth of 3.71 Gbps.&quot;<br>&quot;In Q4 2022, the <span
